SVG+CSS Sharing Icons

I made this in order to avoid using the slow and/or poorly optimized sharing buttons from AddThis or ShareThis. If you cut and paste the CSS into your existing CSS file and the HTML into your web page, it adds absolutely zero HTTP requests to your site.

If you care to support older browsers that don't play nicely with SVG, look into svgweb.

This code is in the public domain. Do what you want with it; I don't care. I didn't design the icons, anyway!

This entry on Stack Overflow should help you customize the code as needed.
